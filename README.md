# Leaflet-Challenge

<h2> Introduction </h2>

* This repository showcases the ability to work with geoJson data to create interactive visual markers on maps.
* This app was created for the Module 15 challenge for the DU Data Analytics Bootcamp.
* All the data used was provided by the the United States Geological Survey (USGS) at https://earthquake.usgs.gov/earthquakes/feed/v1.0/geojson.php and the code was adapted from edX and written with the help of the Xpert Learning Assisstant.
